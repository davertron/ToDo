A Simple Todo App
=================

An app written using [Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).

Why?
----

Why not? I wanted to learn more about using Knockout in a real app. I've done my best to make the usage of Knockout [unobtrusive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript), so you should be able to turn JavaScript off in your browser and the app will still work.

While I've done a lot of Rails programming on my own, I haven't kept up with Rails 3.1, so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

Bootstrap is getting talked about a lot as well, and the less time I have to spend making my app look pretty the better so I thought I'd give it a shot.

I chose MongoDB because the schema for a Todo app is pretty simple and MongoDB allows me to easily and painlessly iterate on it.
